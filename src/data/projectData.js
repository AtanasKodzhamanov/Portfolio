      "DonaDogs was my first and most impactful project. Since its launch in January 2023, the website has had a transformative effect on the rescue center's operations.",
      "Previously, only a handful of dogs had virtual sponsors, now, nearly all of the dogs are virtually adopted. This surge in sponsorship has solved the shelter's ongoing food shortage, enabling them to not only increase the number of dogs they can look after, but also significantly improve the conditions in which these dogs live.",
      "The website content is managed by the shelter through Django's admin panel. It allows the shelter to manage the database of dogs, add pictures, descriptions and allocate them in the appropriate category: sick, adopted, new, etc.",
      'Through the admin panel, the shelter can also add information boxes under each page and also control visuals such as applying different text/title/background color and the relative text positioning.',
